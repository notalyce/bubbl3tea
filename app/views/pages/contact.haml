    Hate Mail and Love Letters

  <p>Feel free to send me an email at <strong>hi [at] alyce.io</strong>! I'll try to get back to you as quickly as possible. I'm also pretty responsive via Twitter <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/notalyce">@notalyce.</a></strong></p>
  <p>If you're sending music promos specifically related to Earmilk, please go through my Earmilk email: <strong>alyce [at] earmilk.com</strong>. I may not respond to all email sent there as I receive a really high volume of promos but I do what I can.</a>
