    Things In Progress

  <p>Things that are keeping my brainparts moving.</p>

  <h3>Wistia</h3>
  <p>My primary focus right now is on my job as Content Strategist at <a href="http://wistia.com">Wistia</a>, a video hosting and marketing platform. I mostly focus my time on being the editor of our <a href="http://wistia.com/blog">blog</a> and overseeing the <a href="http://wistia.com/learning">Learning Center</a> that I helped develop. It's a lot of fun working with people in a wide variety of jobs to hone their writing skills and get their thoughts online.</p>

  <h3>Earmilk</h3>
  <p>I also work as a Senior Editor at the online music magazine <a href="http://earmilk.com">Earmilk</a>, editing writers' pieces and helping to guide the direction of the organization as a whole by serving as a bridge between the business/operations and editorial sides of the publication. My writing for Earmilk these days focuses on artist interviews and event coverage.</p>

  <h3>DJ Lychee</h3>

  <p>I had a radio show and acted as Publicity Director for Tufts' radio station, WMFO, for three years, so I guess it makes sense that since taking a DJ class at Somerville, MA's <a href="http://artisansasylum.com">Artisan's Asylum</a> in summer 2012, I've been playing live a bit more often. I may not have the impulse to create my own music, but I don't think I'll ever get tired of interacting with the music I love as a DJ. My latest mixes can be found on <a href="http://mixcloud.com/notalyce" target="_blank">Mixcloud</a>:</p>

  <h3>Virtuality</h3>

  <p>Virtuality was born in the forests of Vermont during a regional Burning Man event and has since evolved into a little collective of friends organizing music, art, and technology-focused events together. After a series of experiments over the last couple years in our respective houses, we finally threw our first major Boston-based event in December 2013 at a rented loft space in Allston, and as a collective I can only assume we're going to keep growing in 2014.</p>
