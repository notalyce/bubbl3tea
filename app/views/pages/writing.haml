      Scattered writings found in various places around the Internet. Especially with the advent of platforms like <a href="http://medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a>, I've found myself neglecting my own "blog" more and more (Kottke wrote a good piece for Nieman Labs about the <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/the-blog-is-dead/" target="_blank">death of the reverse-chronological blog</a>).

      More and more, I find myself trying to post things where I know they'll reach the most people, and that place is almost never the little blog I have here, regardless of the appeal of purely independent publishing. Here's a little list of links to the things I'm most happy with at the moment.
